# Chapter-8-Demo--Classes-
 
## Overview
In this chapter, students get a first look at object-oriented programming by learning to write your own classes and instantiate objects from them. You will discover how to write constructor methods and initialize object attributes. You will also learn to create class-wide elements such as class attributes and static methods. Finally, you’re introduced to object encapsulation – and shown ways to help ensure this encapsulation, including the use of private attributes.  

## Chapter Objectives
- Create classes to define objects
- Write methods and create attributes for objects
- Instantiate objects from classes
- Restrict access to an object’s attributes
- Work with both new-style and old-style classes
