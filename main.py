OOP 
Object Oriented Programming - Classes 

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

Software Objects allow you to model software objects around real world objects
Creating objects starts with creating CLasses

CONSTRUCTORS 

Constructors are special methods of a class used to setup initial values of an object
This method is called automatically after an object is created

CLASS ATTRIBUTES & STATIC METHODS 

Class attributes allow you to create a single value associated with the class for example 
this would be similar to a post-it stuck to a blueprint. Only one copy exists no matter how
many houses are built from the plans.

"""
OBJECT ENCAPSULATION 

So far we have encapsulated attributes and functions inside our classes 
To abide by OOP rules we should only communicate with objects through parameters & return values

Classes have the ability to encapsulate both public and private methods/ attributes 
Creating private attributes/ methods discourages access from outside of the class

When to implement privacy
    When you write a class: 
    Create methods to reduce need for clients to access object attributes 
    Use privacy for attributes and methods that are internal to the operation of objects
When you use an object:
    Minimize the direct reading on an objectâ€™s attributes
    Avoid directly altering an objects attributes
    Never attempt to directly access an objects private attributes or methods.
